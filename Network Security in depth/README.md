# Network Security Analysis and Implementation
This project focuses on the core principles of network security, emphasizing the design, implementation, and analysis of critical security controls to protect and monitor networked systems effectively.

# Key Highlights
* Security Controls: Explored and implemented essential network security controls, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to safeguard network integrity and availability.
* Cyber Kill Chain Analysis: Provided a comprehensive breakdown of the Cyber Kill Chain, highlighting each stage and the corresponding defensive measures to detect and mitigate potential threats.
* Snort Rules Analysis: Deconstructed and analyzed Snort rules to demonstrate how signature-based detection works and how to customize rules for specific threats.
Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules: Reviewed and developed WAF rules to block malicious traffic and enhance application-level security.
* IDS vs. IPS: Clarified the functional differences between IDS and IPS, with use cases and scenarios for their implementation in modern network security architectures.
# Purpose
This repository serves as a practical resource for understanding the foundational and advanced concepts of network security. It aims to help students, developers, and security professionals enhance their skills in configuring and analyzing network defense mechanisms.

# Tools and Technologies
* Snort: For creating and analyzing intrusion detection and prevention rules.
* Web Application Firewalls: For securing web applications against common threats.
* Network Monitoring Tools: Used to capture and analyze network traffic to identify anomalies.
